tcpflow (0.21-11) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fix broken Debian-specific changes:
    + -C and -c *must* imply -s to strip non-printable characters or
      network data could end up messing with the terminal; this is
      potentially a security issue, hence urgency: high.
    + Reimplement Debian-specific option -e from scratch, the previous
      implementation was tragically flawed: it assumed that the entirety
      of the TCP connection would have only two segments, which is of
      course rarely true...  Do it properly by finding out who's the
      client and who's the server by examining the TCP handshake. Also
      mention -e in usage.
    + Fix spelling errors in Debian-specific patches.
    + Fix the manpage to make explanations actually match their
      corresponding options (closes: #392676).
